## Getting Started üöÄ

### What You'll Need
- [OBS Studio 32.0.1](https://obsproject.com/download) or above
- [C64 Ultimate](https://www.commodore.net/) or [Ultimate 64](https://ultimate64.com/)
- Network connection between your OBS computer and Ultimate device

### Easy Installation üì¶

Grab the right package for your system from the [Releases page](../../releases):

**Windows:**
1. Close OBS Studio
2. Extract `c64stream-*-windows-x64.zip` to `C:\ProgramData\obs-studio\plugins`
3. Restart OBS Studio

If you are using Windows Firewall and block all incoming connections, you may have to setup an exclusion to allow for incoming UDP connections
to port 11000 (Video) and 11001 (Audio) from the C64 Ultimate.

You can do this with the following Powershell script. Be sure to adjust the `RemoteAddress` to the IP of your C64 Ultimate:

```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "C64 Stream" -Direction Inbound -Protocol UDP -LocalPort 11000,11001 -RemoteAddress 192.168.1.64 -Action Allow
```

**macOS:**
1. Close OBS Studio
2. Install `c64stream-*-macos-universal.pkg` to `~/Library/Application Support/obs-studio/plugins`
3. Restart OBS Studio

> [!NOTE]
> macOS support is currently under active development and is not yet fully functional. We're working to resolve compatibility issues and will update this documentation when macOS builds are stable.

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
1. Close OBS Studio
2. Install `c64stream-*-x86_64-linux-gnu.deb` to `~/.config/obs-studio/plugins` by running:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i c64stream-plugin-linux.deb
```

**Further Details:**
See the [OBS Plugins Guide](https://obsproject.com/kb/plugins-guide).


### Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

![C64U Configuration](./doc/img/ObsPluginProperties.png "C64U Configuration")

**Getting Your C64 on Stream:**

1. **Add Source:** In OBS, create a new source and select "C64 Stream" from the available types
2. **Open Properties:** Select the "C64 Stream" source in your sources list, then click the "Properties" button to open the configuration dialog
3. **Debug Logging:** Enable detailed logging for debugging connection issues (optional)
4. **Configure Network Settings:**
   - **DNS Server IP:** IP address of DNS server for resolving device hostnames (default: `192.168.1.1` for most home routers). Used when the C64U Host is a hostname rather than an IP address.
   - **C64U Host:** Enter your Ultimate device's hostname (default: `c64u`) or IP address to enable automatic streaming control from OBS (recommended for convenience), or set to `0.0.0.0` to accept streams from any C64 Ultimate on your network (requires manual control from the device)
   - **OBS Server IP:** IP address where C64 Ultimate sends streams (auto-detected by default)
   - **Auto-detect OBS IP:** Automatically detect and use OBS server IP in streaming commands (recommended)
5. **Configure Ports:** Use the default ports (video: 11000, audio: 11001) unless network conflicts require different values
6. **Render Delay:** Adjust frame buffering (0-100 frames, default 3) to smooth UDP packet loss/reordering
7. **Recording Options (Optional):**
   - **Save BMP Frames:** Enable to save individual frames as BMP files (useful for debugging, impacts performance)
   - **Record AVI + WAV:** Enable to record uncompressed video and audio files (high disk usage)
   - **Output Folder:** Choose where recording files are saved. Default locations by OS:
     - #### Recording Directory

The plugin automatically creates recordings in platform-specific directories:

  - **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\obs-studio\c64stream\recordings`
     - **macOS:** `~/Documents/obs-studio/c64stream/recordings`
     - **Linux:** `~/Documents/obs-studio/c64stream/recordings`
8. **Apply Settings:** Click "OK" to save your configuration

Once configured, live video and audio streams from the C64 Ultimate will be available in OBS Studio.

### Ultimate Device Setup üéõÔ∏è

**Automatic Configuration (Recommended):** The OBS plugin automatically controls streaming on the Ultimate device. When you configure the Ultimate's hostname or IP address in the OBS plugin settings, the plugin tells the Ultimate device where to send streams and sends start commands automatically. Thus, no manual streaming adjustments are needed on the Ultimate device.

**Manual Configuration:**
1. Press F2 to access the Ultimate's configuration menu
2. Navigate to "Data Streams" section
3. Set "Stream VIC to" field: `your-obs-ip:11000` (e.g., `192.168.1.100:11000`)
4. Set "Stream Audio to" field: `your-obs-ip:11001` (e.g., `192.168.1.100:11001`)
5. Save configuration changes
6. Manually start streaming from the Ultimate device

For comprehensive configuration details, refer to the [official C64 Ultimate documentation](https://1541u-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_streams.html).

### Hostname vs IP Address üåê

The plugin supports both **hostnames** and **IP addresses** for the C64U Host field with enhanced DNS resolution that works reliably across all platforms:

**Using Hostnames (Recommended):**
- **Default:** `c64u` - The plugin will try to resolve this hostname to an IP address
- **Custom:** `my-c64u` or `retro-pc` - Use any hostname your C64 Ultimate device is known by
- **FQDN Support:** The plugin automatically tries both `hostname` and `hostname.` (with trailing dot) for proper DNS resolution

**Using IP Addresses:**
- **Direct IP:** `192.168.1.64` - Standard IPv4 address format
- **Fallback:** `0.0.0.0` - Accept streams from any C64 Ultimate (no automatic control)

**DNS Resolution:**

The plugin offers hostname resolution that works reliably on Linux and macOS where system DNS may fail for local device names:

1. **System DNS First:** Tries standard system DNS resolution (works for internet hostnames and properly configured networks)
2. **FQDN Resolution:** Attempts resolution with trailing dot (e.g., `c64u.` for some network configurations)
3. **Direct DNS Queries:** On Linux/macOS, bypasses systemd-resolved by querying DNS servers directly:
   - Uses configured **DNS Server IP** (default: `192.168.1.1`)
   - Falls back to common router IPs: `192.168.0.1`, `10.0.0.1`, `172.16.0.1`
4. **Cross-Platform:** Windows uses system DNS (which works reliably), Linux/macOS use enhanced resolution

**DNS Server Configuration:**
- **Default:** `192.168.1.1` (most common home router DNS server)
- **Custom:** Set to your router's IP or a specific DNS server (e.g., `192.168.0.1`, `10.0.0.1`)
- **Automatic Fallback:** If the configured DNS server fails, tries other common router IPs
- **Why This Helps:** Solves Linux/macOS issues where `c64u` hostname doesn't resolve through system DNS but works via direct router queries

**Examples:**
- `c64u` ‚Üí resolves to `192.168.1.64` via enhanced DNS resolution
- `192.168.1.64` ‚Üí used directly as IP address
- `retro-basement.local` ‚Üí resolves via mDNS/Bonjour or direct DNS
- `ultimate64` ‚Üí tries system DNS first, then direct router DNS queries

**Platform-Specific Behavior:**
- **Windows:** Uses system DNS (typically works without issues)
- **Linux/macOS:** Uses enhanced DNS resolution to bypass systemd-resolved limitations
- **All Platforms:** Support both hostname and IP address formats seamlessly

## Recording Features üìπ

The plugin includes built-in recording capabilities that work independently of OBS Studio's recording system, letting you save raw C64 Ultimate data streams directly to disk.

### Recording Options

**Frame Saving (BMP):**
- Saves individual video frames as uncompressed BMP files
- Useful for debugging video issues or creating frame-by-frame analysis
- **Performance Impact:** Enabling this feature will reduce streaming performance due to disk I/O
- Files saved as: `session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/frames/frame_NNNNNN.bmp`

**Video Recording (AVI + WAV):**
- Records uncompressed AVI video and separate WAV audio files
- Captures the raw data stream without OBS processing
- **High Disk Usage:** Uncompressed video files are very large (~50MB per minute)
- Video file: `session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/video.avi` (24-bit BGR format)
- Audio file: `session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/audio.wav` (16-bit stereo PCM)

### File Organization

All recording files are organized into session folders with timestamps:
```
~/Documents/obs-studio/c64stream/recordings/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ session_20240929_143052/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frames/           # BMP frame files (if enabled)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ video.avi         # Uncompressed video (if enabled)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ audio.wav         # Uncompressed audio (if enabled)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ session_20240929_151234/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Recording Configuration

- **Output Folder Defaults:**
  - **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\obs-studio\c64stream\recordings`
  - **macOS:** `~/Documents/obs-studio/c64stream/recordings`
  - **Linux:** `~/Documents/obs-studio/c64stream/recordings`
- **Automatic Session Management:** New session folder created each time recording is enabled
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Usage Notes

- Recording operates independently of OBS Studio's built-in recording
- Both recording options can be enabled simultaneously
- **Recording starts immediately when a checkbox is checked and continues until unchecked**
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Checkbox states persist across OBS restarts - uncheck to stop recording or risk filling disk space**
- Files are written in real-time as data is received from the C64 Ultimate
- Session folders are created automatically with proper directory structure

## Troubleshooting üîç

**No video stream? üì∫**
- Verify that both IP addresses are correct
- Check Ultimate device has data streaming enabled
- Confirm firewall allows UDP traffic on configured ports

**Audio sync issues? üîä**
- Check audio port configuration (default 11001)
- Verify OBS audio monitoring settings

**Plugin missing from OBS? ü§î**
- Confirm OBS Studio version 32.0.1+
- Verify plugin installed to correct directory
- Check OBS logs for plugin loading errors
- Restart OBS completely after installation

**Connection acting up? üì°**
- Network latency should be <100ms for optimal performance
- Check for network congestion or WiFi interference
- Consider wired Ethernet connection for stability

**Hostname not resolving? üåê**

If the plugin can't resolve your C64 Ultimate hostname (e.g., `c64u`), try these solutions:

*Quick Fix:*
1. **Use IP Address:** Instead of `c64u`, enter the device's IP address directly (e.g., `192.168.1.64`)
2. **Check DNS Server IP:** Verify the DNS Server IP setting matches your router's IP address
   - Common router IPs: `192.168.1.1`, `192.168.0.1`, `10.0.0.1`
   - Find your router IP: Run `ip route | grep default` (Linux) or `ipconfig` (Windows)

*Advanced Troubleshooting:*
1. **Test DNS Resolution Manually:**
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS - Test if router can resolve the hostname
   dig @192.168.1.1 c64u

   # Windows - Test DNS resolution
   nslookup c64u 192.168.1.1
   ```

2. **Platform-Specific Issues:**
   - **Linux:** systemd-resolved may not forward local hostnames to router DNS
   - **macOS:** Similar DNS forwarding issues with local device names
   - **Windows:** System DNS typically works without issues

3. **Configure Custom DNS Server:**
   - Set **DNS Server IP** to your router's IP address (usually `192.168.1.1`)
   - Try alternative common router IPs: `192.168.0.1`, `10.0.0.1`
   - Check your router's DHCP settings for the correct DNS server IP

4. **Enable Debug Logging:**
   - Check "Debug Logging" in plugin properties
   - Look for DNS resolution messages in OBS logs
   - Messages show which DNS resolution method succeeded

*Alternative Solutions:*
- **Static DNS Entry:** Add `192.168.1.64 c64u` to your system's hosts file
- **mDNS/Bonjour:** Use `.local` suffix (e.g., `c64u.local`) if your network supports it
- **Router Configuration:** Ensure your router's DNS server has the device hostname registered

**Recording troubles? üíæ**
- **Files not created:** Verify output folder path exists and is writable
- **Performance drops with BMP saving:** Frame saving impacts performance significantly; disable if not needed
- **Large disk usage:** AVI recording creates uncompressed files (~50MB/minute); monitor disk space
- **Recording stops unexpectedly:** Check disk space and folder permissions
